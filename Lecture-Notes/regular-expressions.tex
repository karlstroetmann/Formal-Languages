\chapter{Regular Expressions \label{chapter:regular-expressions}}
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression}{\emph{Regular expressions}} are linguistic constructs designed to specify formal languages simple enough to be recognized by a \blue{finite state machine}. The notion of finite state machines will be elaborated upon in Chapter \ref{chapter:finit-state-machines.tex}. Regular expressions enable the specification of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Alternatives among different options,
\item Concatenation of elements, and
\item Repetition of elements.
\end{enumerate}

Regular expressions form the backbone of many modern scripting languages. For instance, the initial surge in the popularity of the programming language \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl}{\textsl{Perl}} can be largely attributed to its efficient handling of regular expressions. Nowadays, nearly all high-level programming languages, such as \textsl{Python}, \textsl{Java}, and \texttt{C\#}, offer comprehensive libraries to support regular expressions. 

Moreover, various \textsc{Unix} utilities, including \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep}{\texttt{grep}}, \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed}{\texttt{sed}}, and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awk}{\texttt{awk}}, are fundamentally based on regular expressions. Consequently, proficiency in regular expressions is indispensable for budding computer scientists.

In this chapter, we will introduce a definition of regular expressions that is more concise than those typically found in programming languages. This streamlined definition will facilitate our theoretical examination of regular languages in Chapters 4 and 5. The syntax of regular expressions as used in \textsl{Python} will be covered in the subsequent chapter.

\section{Preliminary Definitions}
Before delving into the syntax and semantics of regular expressions, we need to introduce some preliminary definitions.

\begin{Definition}[Product of Languages]
  Given an alphabet \( \Sigma \) and formal languages \( L_1, L_2 \subseteq \Sigma^* \), the \blue{product} of \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) is denoted as \( L_1 \cdot L_2 \) and is defined as the set of all concatenations \( w_1 \cdot w_2 \) where \( w_1 \in L_1 \) and \( w_2 \in L_2 \). Formally, 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$ L_1 \cdot L_2 := \{ w_1 \cdot w_2 \mid w_1 \in L_1 \land w_2 \in L_2 \}$. \eox 
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
Suppose \( \Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} \} \) and \( L_1 \) and \( L_2 \) are given by
\[
L_1 = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{bc} \} \quad \text{and} \quad L_2 = \{ \texttt{ac}, \texttt{cb} \},
\]
then \( L_1 \cdot L_2 = \{ \texttt{abac}, \texttt{abcb}, \texttt{bcac}, \texttt{bccb} \} \). \eox
\pagebreak

\begin{Definition}[Power of a Language]
Let \( \Sigma \) be an alphabet, \( L \subseteq \Sigma^* \) a formal language, and \( n \in \mathbb{N} \). The \( n \)-th \blue{power} of \( L \), denoted as \( L^n \), is defined inductively as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[B.C.:] \( n = 0 \):

             \( L^0 := \{ \varepsilon \} \), \quad where \( \varepsilon \) is the empty string.
\item[I.S.:] \( n \mapsto n + 1 \):
             
             \( L^{n+1} = L^n \cdot L \). \eox
\end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
For \( \Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b} \} \) and \( L = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \} \), we find:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \( L^0 = \{ \varepsilon \} \),
\item \( L^1 = L \),
\item \( L^2 = \{ \texttt{abab}, \texttt{abba}, \texttt{baab}, \texttt{baba} \} \). \eox
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Definition}[Kleene Closure]
  Given an alphabet \( \Sigma \) and a formal language \( L \subseteq \Sigma^* \), the \blue{Kleene closure} of \( L \), denoted as \( L^* \), is the union of all \( L^n \) for \( n \in \mathbb{N} \):
  \[
  L^* := \bigcup_{n \in \mathbb{N}} L^n = L^0 \cup L^1 \cup L^2 \cup \cdots
  \]
  Note that \( \varepsilon \in L^* \), so \( L^* \) is never empty, even when \( L = \{\} \). \qed
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
Let \( \Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b} \} \) and \( L = \{ \texttt{a} \} \). Then
\[
L^* = \{ \texttt{a}^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N} \},
\]
where \( \texttt{a}^n \) represents a string of \( n \) consecutive \texttt{a}'s. \eox

Formally, for a string \( s \) and a non-negative integer \( n \in \mathbb{N} \), the expression \( s^n \) is defined inductively:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[B.C.:] \( n = 0 \):

             \( s^0 := \varepsilon \).
\item[I.S.:] \( n \mapsto n + 1 \):

             \( s^{n+1} := s^n \cdot s \),  \quad where \( s^n \cdot s \) represents the concatenation of \( s^n \) and \( s \).
\eox
\end{enumerate}

This highlights that the Kleene closure of a finite language can be infinite. Specifically, \( L^* \) will be infinite whenever \( L \) contains a string different from \( \varepsilon \).


\section{The Formal Definition of Regular Expressions}
We proceed to define the set of regular expressions for a given alphabet \( \Sigma \). This set is denoted as
\( \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \), and is defined inductively. Simultaneously, we define the function 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$L: \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow 2^{\Sigma^*}$,
\\[0.2cm]
which interprets each regular expression \( r \) as a formal language \( L(r) \subseteq 2^{\Sigma^*} \).\footnote{
  Given a set \( M \), the \blue{power set} of \( M \), i.e., the set of all subsets of \( M \), is denoted as \( 2^M \).
}
\pagebreak

\begin{Definition}[Regular Expressions]
  The set \( \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \) of \blue{regular expressions} on the alphabet \( \Sigma \) is defined inductively as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\emptyset \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$ \index{$\emptyset$}

        The regular expression $\emptyset$ denotes the empty language, we have
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(\emptyset) := \{\}$.

        In order to avoid confusion we assume that the symbol $\emptyset$ is \underline{not} a member of the
        alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\emptyset \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $\varepsilon \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$ \index{$\varepsilon$}

        The regular expression $\varepsilon$ denotes the language that only contains the empty
        string $\varepsilon$: 
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(\varepsilon) := \{ \varepsilon \}$.
        \\[0.2cm]
        Observe that in this equation the two occurrences of $\varepsilon$ are interpreted differently:
        The occurrence of $\varepsilon$ on the left hand side of this equation denotes a regular
        expression, while the occurrence of $\varepsilon$ on the right hand side denotes the empty
        string.

        Furthermore, we assume that $\varepsilon \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $c \in \Sigma \rightarrow c \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$.

        Every character from the alphabet $\Sigma$ is a regular expression.  This expression denotes
        the language that contains only the string $c$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(c) := \{ c \}$.
        \\[0.2cm]
        Observe that we identify characters with strings of length one.
  \item $r_1 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \wedge r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma
         \rightarrow r_1 + r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Starting from two regular expressions $r_1$ and $r_2$ we can use the  infix operator
        ``$+$'' to build a new regular expression.  This regular expression denotes the union of 
        the languages described by $r_1$ and $r_2$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r_1 + r_2) := L(r_1) \cup L(r_2)$.

        In order to avoid confusion we have to assume that the symbol  ``\texttt{+}'' does not occur
        in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have  $\squoted{+} \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $r_1 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \wedge r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma 
         \rightarrow r_1 \cdot r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Starting from the regular expression $r_1$ and $r_2$ we can use the  infix operator
        ``$\cdot$'' to build a new regular expression.  This regular expression denotes
        the product of the languages of $r_1$ and $r_2$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r_1 \cdot r_2) := L(r_1) \cdot L(r_2)$.

        Again, in order to avoid confusion we have to assume that the symbol ``$\cdot$'' does not
        occur in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\squoted{$\cdot$} \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $r \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow r^* \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Given a regular expression $r$, the postfix operator
        ``$^*$'' can be used to create a new regular expression.  This new regular expression
        denotes the Kleene closure of the language described by  $r$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r^*) := \bigl(L(r)\bigr)^*$.

        We have to assume that $\squoted{$^*$} \not\in \Sigma$. 
  \item $r \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow (r) \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Regular expressions can be surrounded by parentheses.  This does not change the language
        denoted by the regular expression:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L\bigl((r)\bigr) := L(r)$. 

        We have to assume that the parentheses  \qote{(} and \qote{)} do not occur
        in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\squoted{(} \not\in \Sigma$  and $\squoted{)} \not\in \Sigma$. \eox
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

Given the preceding definition, it is unclear whether to interpret the regular expression
\[
\mathtt{a} + \mathtt{b} \cdot \mathtt{c},
\]
as either
\[
(\mathtt{a} + \mathtt{b}) \cdot \mathtt{c} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathtt{a} + (\mathtt{b} \cdot \mathtt{c}).
\]
To remove this ambiguity, we assign \blue{operator precedences} as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The postfix operator \( ^* \) has the highest precedence.
\item The infix operator \( \cdot \) has lower precedence than \( ^* \) but higher precedence than \( + \).
\item The operator \( + \) has the lowest precedence.
\end{enumerate}
With these conventions, the expression
\[
\mathrm{a} + \mathrm{b} \cdot \mathrm{c}^*
\]
is interpreted as
\[
\mathrm{a} + \left( \mathrm{b} \cdot \left( \mathrm{c}^* \right) \right).
\]

\examplesEng
In the following examples, the alphabet \( \Sigma \) is defined as
\[
\Sigma := \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} \}.
\]
\begin{enumerate}
\item \( r_1 := (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c}) \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c}) \)

      This expression \( r_1 \) denotes the set of all strings from $\Sigma^*$ that have length 2:
      \[
      L(r_1) = \bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid |w| = 2 \bigr\}.
      \]
      
\item \( r_2 := (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c}) \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \)

      This expression \( r_2 \) denotes the set of all strings from $\Sigma^*$ that have at least length 1:
      \[
      L(r_2) = \bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid |w| \geq 1 \bigr\}.
      \]

\item \( r_3 := (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{a} \cdot (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \)

      This expression \( r_3 \) denotes the set of all strings from $\Sigma^*$ that have exactly one occurrence of the letter \texttt{a}:
      \[
      L(r_3) = \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \#\bigl\{i \in \mathbb{N} \mid w[i] = \texttt{a} \bigr\} = 1 \Bigr\}.
      \]

\item \( r_4 :=  (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{a} \cdot (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* + (\texttt{a} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{b} \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{c})^* \)

      This expression \( r_4 \) denotes the set of all strings from $\Sigma^*$ that either contain exactly one
      occurrence of the letter \texttt{a} or exactly one occurrence of the letter \texttt{b}: 
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_4) = \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \#\bigl\{i \in \mathbb{N} \mid w[i] = \texttt{a} \bigr\} = 1
      \Bigr\} \cup \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \mid \#\bigl\{i \in \mathbb{N} \mid w[i] = \texttt{b} \bigr\} = 1
      \Bigr\}$.  \eox
\end{enumerate}

\remarkEng
The syntax of regular expressions given here is the same as the syntax used in \cite{hopcroft:06}. However, the
syntax used for regular expressions in programming languages like \textsl{Python} differs. These differences
will be discussed later.

\exerciseEng
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Assume \( \Sigma = \{ \mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c} \} \). Define a regular expression for the language \( L \subseteq \Sigma^* \) that consists of those strings that contain at least one occurrence of the letter ``\texttt{a}'' and one occurrence of the letter ``\texttt{b}''.

\item Assume \( \Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \} \). Specify a regular expression for the language \( L \subseteq \Sigma^* \) that consists of those strings \( s \) such that the \href{https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/antepenultimate}{antepenultimate} character is the symbol ``\( 1 \)''.

\item Again, assume \( \Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \} \). Define a regular expression for the language \( L \subseteq \Sigma^* \) containing all those strings that do not contain the substring \( 110 \).

      % \solutionEng
      % The regular expression $r$ that is sought for can be defined as 
      % \\[0.2cm]
      % \hspace*{1.3cm}
      % $r = (0 + 1 \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.
      % \\[0.2cm]
      % First, it is quite obvious that the language $L(r)$ does not contain a string $w$ such that
      % $w$ contains the substring $110$.  This is so because a character $1$ that is generated by the
      % part $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$ is immediately followed by a $0$.  Hence if $w$ contains the
      % substring $110$, the first $1$ cannot originate from the regular expression $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.
      % Furthermore, if the first $1$ of the substring 110 originates from the regular expression
      % $1^*$, then there cannot be a $0$ following since the language generated by $1^*$ contains
      % only ones.

      % Second, assume that the string $w$ does not contain the substring $110$.  We have to show that
      % $w \in L(r)$.  Now if the character $1$ does not occur in the
      % string $w$, then $w$ is just a bunch of zeros and therefore $w$ can be generated by the
      % regular expression $(0+1\cdot 0)^*$ and hence also by $(0 + 1  \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.  If the string $w$
      % does contain the character $1$, there are two cases.
      % \begin{enumerate}
      % \item The first occurrence of $1$ is followed by a $0$.  Then the prefix of $w$ up to and
      %       including this $0$ is generated by the regular expression $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.  The
      %       remaining part of $w$ is shorter and, by induction, can be shown to be generated by 
      %       $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.
      % \item The first occurrence of $1$ is followed by another $1$.  In this case, the rest of $w$
      %       must be made up of ones.  Hence, the part of $w$ starting with the first $1$ is
      %       generated by $1^*$ and obviously the preceding zeros can all be generated by 
      %       $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.
      % \end{enumerate}
\item Again, assume \( \Sigma = \{0,1\} \). What is the language \( L \) generated by the regular expression 
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $(1 + \varepsilon)\cdot(0\cdot 0^* \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0^*$? \eox

      % \solutionEng
      % This is the language \( L \) such that the strings in \( L \) do not contain the substring \( 11 \).

\section{Algebraic Simplification of Regular Expressions}
Given two regular expressions \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \), we use the notation
\[
\hspace*{1.3cm}
r_1 \doteq r_2 \quad \text{iff} \quad L(r_1) = L(r_2),
\]
to indicate that \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) describe the same language. If the equation \( r_1 \doteq r_2 \)
holds, then we refer to \( r_1 \) and \( r_2 \) as \blue{equivalent}.\index{equivalence of regular expressions} The following algebraic laws are
applicable: 
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item $r_1 + r_2 \doteq r_2 + r_1$

      This equation is true because the union operator is commutative for sets:
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_1 + r_2) = L(r_1) \cup L(r_2) = L(r_2) \cup L(r_1) = L(r_2 + r_1)$.
\item $(r_1 + r_2) + r_3 \doteq r_1 + (r_2 + r_3)$

      This equation is true because the union operator is associative for sets.
\item $(r_1 \cdot r_2) \cdot r_3 \doteq r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot r_3)$

      This equation is true because the concatenation of strings is associative, for any strings
      $u$, $v$, and $w$ we have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $(u v) w = u (v w)$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      This implies
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $
      \begin{array}[t]{lcl}
        L\bigl( (r_1 \cdot r_2) \cdot r_3\bigr) 
        & = & \bigl\{ x w \mid x \in L(r_1 \cdot r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ (u v) w \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge v \in L(r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ u (v w) \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge v \in L(r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ u y \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge y \in L(r_2 \cdot r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & L\bigl( r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot r_3)\bigr).
      \end{array}
      $

      The following equations are more or less obvious.
\item $\emptyset \cdot r \doteq r \cdot \emptyset \doteq \emptyset$
\item $\varepsilon \cdot r \doteq r \cdot \varepsilon \doteq r$
\item $\emptyset + r \doteq r + \emptyset \doteq r$
\item $(r_1 + r_2) \cdot r_3 \doteq r_1 \cdot r_3 + r_2 \cdot r_3$
\item $r_1 \cdot (r_2 + r_3) \doteq r_1 \cdot r_2 + r_1 \cdot r_3$
\item $r + r \doteq r$, because
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r+r) = L(r) \cup L(r) = L(r)$.
\item $(r^*)^* \doteq r^*$      

      We have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r^*) = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} L(r)^n$ 
      \\[0.2cm]
      and that implies $L(r) \subseteq L(r^*)$.   This holds true if we replace  $r$ by  $r^*$. Therefore
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r^*) \subseteq L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$
      \\[0.2cm]
      holds.  In order to prove the inclusion
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) \subseteq L(r^*)$,
      \\[0.2cm]
      we consider the structure of the strings  $w \in L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$.
      Because of
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}} L(r^*)^n$
      \\[0.2cm]
      we have $w \in L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$ if and only if there is an $n \in \mathbb{N}$
      such that there are strings $u_1, \cdots,u_n \in L(r^*)$ satisfying
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $w = u_1 \cdots u_n$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Because of $u_i \in L(r^*)$ we find a number $m(i) \in \mathbb{N}$ for every $i \in \{1,\cdots,n\}$ 
      such that for  $j=1,\cdots, m(i)$ there are strings $v_{i,j} \in L(r)$ satisfying
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $u_i = v_{1,i} \cdots v_{m(i),i}$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Combining these equations yields
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $w = v_{1,1} \cdots v_{m(1),1} v_{1,2} \cdots v_{m(2),2} \cdots v_{1,n} \cdots v_{m(n),n}$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Hence $w$ is a concatenation of strings from the language $L(r)$ and hence we have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $w \in L\bigl(r^*\bigr)$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      This shows the inclusion
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) \subseteq L(r^*)$.
\item $\emptyset^* \doteq \varepsilon$
\item $\varepsilon^* \doteq \varepsilon$
\item $r^* \doteq \varepsilon + r^* \cdot r$
\item $r^* \doteq (\varepsilon + r)^*$
\end{enumerate}
