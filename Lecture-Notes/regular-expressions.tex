\chapter{Regular Expressions \label{chapter:regular-expressions}}
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression}{\emph{Regular expressions}} are terms that
specify those formal languages that are simple enough to be recognized by a \blue{finite state machine}.
The concept of finite state machines will be discussed in chapter \ref{chapter:finit-state-machines.tex}.
A regular expression is able to specify 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the choice between different alternatives,
\item concatenation, and
\item repetition.
\end{enumerate}
Many modern scripting languages are based on regular expression, for example
the success of the programming language \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl}{\textsl{Perl}} is
largely due to its efficiency in dealing with regular expressions.
All modern high-level languages, e.g.~\textsl{Java}, \texttt{C\#}, and many others
provide extensive libraries to support regular expressions.  Furthermore, there are a number of 
\textsc{Unix} tools like \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep}{\texttt{grep}}, 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed}{\texttt{sed}} or
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awk}{\texttt{awk}} that are based on regular expressions.  Hence,
every aspiring computer scientist needs to be comfortable with regular expressions.


\section{Preliminary Definitions}
Before we can define the syntax and semantics of regular expressions, we need some auxiliary definitions. 


\begin{Definition}[Product of Languages]
  If $\Sigma$ is an  alphabet and $L_1 \subseteq \Sigma^*$ and $L_2 \subseteq \Sigma^*$ are formal
  languages, the \emph{product} of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is written as
  $L_1 \cdot L_2$ and is defined as the set of all concatenations $w_1w_2$ such that $w_1 \in L_1$ and
  $w_2 \in L_2$, i.e.~we have
  \\[0.2cm]
  \hspace*{1.3cm}
  $L_1 \cdot L_2 := \bigl\{ w_1w_2 \mid w_1 \in L_1 \wedge w_2 \in L_2 \bigr\}$. \eox
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
If $\Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} \}$ and $L_1$ and $L_2$ are defined as
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$L_1 = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{bc} \}$ \quad and \quad
$L_2 = \{ \texttt{ac}, \texttt{cb} \}$. 
\\[0.2cm]
Then the product of $L_1$ and $L_2$ is given as
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$L_1 \cdot L_2 = \{ \texttt{abac}, \texttt{abcb}, \texttt{bcac}, \texttt{bccb} \}$.  \eox

\begin{Definition}[Power of a Language] 
Assume $\Sigma$ is an  alphabet, $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is a formal language and $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$.
The  \emph{$n$-th power} of $L$ is written as  $L^n$ and is definition by induction on  $n$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item[B.C.:] $n = 0$: 

      $L^0 := \{ \varepsilon \}$.

      Here $\varepsilon$ denotes the empty string.  If we would write a string as a list of its characters we would have
      $\varepsilon = []$.
\item[I.S.:] $n \mapsto n + 1$:

      $L^{n+1} = L^n \cdot L$  \eox
\end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
If $\Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b} \}$ and $L = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \}$, we have
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L^0 = \{ \varepsilon \}$,
\item $L^1 = \{ \varepsilon \} \cdot \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \} = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \}$,
\item $L^2 = \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \} \cdot \{ \texttt{ab}, \texttt{ba} \} = 
             \{ \texttt{abab}, \texttt{abba}, \texttt{baab}, \texttt{baba} \}$.  \eox
\end{enumerate}

\begin{Definition}[Kleene Closure]
  Assume that $\Sigma$ is an Alphabet and $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ is some formal language. Then the
  \emph{Kleene closure} of $L$ is written as $L^*$ and is defined to be the union of all powers
  $L^n$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$: 
  \\[0.2cm]
  \hspace*{1.3cm}
  $L^* := \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0} L^n = L^0 \cup L^1 \cup L^2 \cup L^3 \cup \cdots$.
  \\[0.2cm]
  Note that $\mathbb{N}_0 = \{0\} \cup \mathbb{N}$. Therefore, $\varepsilon \in L^*$.
  \qed  
\end{Definition}

\exampleEng
Assume $\Sigma = \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b} \}$ and  $L = \{ \texttt{a} \}$.  Then we have
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$L^* = \{ \texttt{a}^n \mid n \in \mathbb{N}_0 \}$.
\\[0.2cm]
Here $\texttt{a}^n$ is the string of length $n$ that contains only the letter \texttt{a}.  Hence, we have 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\texttt{a}^n = \underbrace{\texttt{a} \cdots \texttt{a}}_n$.  \eox 


Formally, given a string $s$ and an non-negative integer Zahl $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$, we define the expression
 $s^n$ by induction on  $n$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[B.C.:] $n = 0$

             $s^0 := \varepsilon$. 
\item[I.S.:] $n \mapsto n + 1$

             $s^{n+1} := s^n s$, \quad where $s^n s$ denotes the concatenation of the strings $s^n$ and $s$.
             \eox
\end{enumerate}

The previous example shows that the Kleene closure of a finite language can be infinite.
It is easy to see that the Kleene closure of a language $L$ is infinite
if $L$ contains at least one string $s$ such that $|s| > 0$.

\section{How to Define Regular Expressions}
We proceed to define the set of regular expressions given an  alphabet $\Sigma$.  This set is
denoted as $\texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$.  This set is defined by induction.  Simultaneously,  we define
the function
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$L: \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow 2^{\Sigma^*}$
\\[0.2cm]
which interprets every regular expression  $r$ as a formal language $L(r) \subseteq \Sigma^*$.\footnote{
  Given a set $M$ the power set of $M$, i.e.~the set of all subsets of $M$, is denoted as $2^M$.
}

\begin{Definition}[Regular Expressions]
  The set $\texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$ of \emph{regular expressions} on the alphabet  $\Sigma$ is defined
  by induction as follows:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item $\emptyset \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        The regular expression $\emptyset$ denotes the empty language, we have
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(\emptyset) := \{\}$.

        In order to avoid confusion we assume that the symbol $\emptyset$ is not a member of the
        alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\emptyset \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $\varepsilon \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        The regular expression $\varepsilon$ denotes the language that only contains the empty
        string $\varepsilon$: 
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(\varepsilon) := \{ \varepsilon \}$.
        \\[0.2cm]
        Observe that in this equation the two occurrences of $\varepsilon$ are interpreted differently:
        The occurrence of $\varepsilon$ on the left hand side of this equation denotes a regular
        expression, while the occurrence of $\varepsilon$ on the right hand side denotes the empty
        string.
  \item $c \in \Sigma \rightarrow c \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$.

        Every character from the alphabet $\Sigma$ is a regular expression.  This expression denotes
        the language that contains only the string $c$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(c) := \{ c \}$.
        \\[0.2cm]
        Observe that we identify characters with strings of length one.
  \item $r_1 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \wedge r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma
         \rightarrow r_1 + r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Starting from two regular expressions $r_1$ and $r_2$ we can use the  infix operator
        ``$+$'' to build a new regular expression.  This regular expression denotes the union of 
        the languages described by $r_1$ and $r_2$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r_1 + r_2) := L(r_1) \cup L(r_2)$.

        In order to avoid confusion we have to assume that the symbol  ``\texttt{+}'' does not occur
        in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have  $\squoted{+} \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $r_1 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \wedge r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma 
         \rightarrow r_1 \cdot r_2 \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Starting from the regular expression $r_1$ and $r_2$ we can use the  infix operator
        ``$\cdot$'' to build s new regular expression.  This regular expression denotes
        the product of the languages of $r_1$ and $r_2$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r_1 \cdot r_2) := L(r_1) \cdot L(r_2)$.

        Again, in order to avoid confusion we have to assume that the symbol ``$\cdot$'' does not
        occur in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\squoted{$\cdot$} \not\in \Sigma$.
  \item $r \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow r^* \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Given a regular expression $r$, the postfix operator
        ``$^*$'' can be used to create a new regular expression.  This new regular expression
        denotes the Kleene closure of the language described by  $r$:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L(r^*) := \bigl(L(r)\bigr)^*$.

        We have to assume that $\squoted{$^*$} \not\in \Sigma$. 
  \item $r \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma \rightarrow (r) \in \texttt{RegExp}_\Sigma$

        Regular expressions my be surrounded by parentheses.  This does not change the language
        denoted by the regular expression:
        \\[0.2cm]
        \hspace*{1.3cm}
        $L\bigl((r)\bigr) := L(r)$. 

        We have to assume that the parentheses  \qote{(} and \qote{)} do not occur
        in the alphabet $\Sigma$, i.e.~we have $\squoted{(} \not\in \Sigma$  and $\squoted{)} \not\in \Sigma$. \eox
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Definition}
Given the preceding definition it is not clear whether the regular expression
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\mathtt{a}+\mathtt{b}\cdot\mathtt{c}$ 
\\[0.2cm]
is to be interpreted as 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$(\mathtt{a}+\mathtt{b})\cdot\mathtt{c}$ \quad or \quad $\mathtt{a}+(\mathtt{b}\cdot\mathtt{c})$.
\\[0.2cm]
In order to ensure that regular expressions can be read unambiguously we have to assign \emph{operator precedences}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The postfix operator ``$^*$'' has the highest precedence.
\item The precedence of the infix operator ``$\cdot$'' is lower than the precedence of  ``$^*$'' but
      stronger than the precedence of ``$+$''.
\item The operator ``$+$'' has the lowest precedence.
\end{enumerate}
Using these conventions, the regular expression 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\mathrm{a} + \mathrm{b} \cdot \mathrm{c}^*$ \quad is interpreted as  \quad
$\mathrm{a} + \bigl(\mathrm{b} \cdot (\mathrm{c}^*)\bigr)$.

\examplesEng
In the following examples, the alphabet  $\Sigma$ is defined as
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\Sigma := \{ \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c} \}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r_1 := (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c}) \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c})$

      The expression  $r_1$ denotes the set of all strings that have the length $2$:
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_1) = \bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \,\big|\; |w| = 2 \bigr\}$.
\item $r_2 := (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c}) \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^*$

      The expression  $r_2$ denotes the set of all strings that have at least length $1$:
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_2) = \bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \,\big|\; |w| \geq 1 \bigr\}$.
\item $r_3 := (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{a} \cdot 
              (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^*$

      The expression $r_3$ denotes the set of all those strings that have exactly one occurrence of
      the letter ``\texttt{a}'''.  A string containing exactly one ``\texttt{a}''
      is a string that starts with an arbitrary amount of the letters \texttt{b} and \texttt{c} 
      (this is what $(\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^*$ denotes), followed by the letter ``\texttt{a}'',
      followed by another substring containing only the letters \texttt{b} and \texttt{c}.
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_3) = \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \;\Big|\;\; 
                        \#\bigl\{i \in  \mathbb{N}_0 \,\big|\; w[i] = \texttt{a} \bigl\} \,= 1 \Bigr\}$.
\item $r_4 :=  (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{a} \cdot (\texttt{b} + \texttt{c})^* +
               (\texttt{a} + \texttt{c})^* \cdot \texttt{b} \cdot (\texttt{a} + \texttt{c})^*$

      The regular expression $r_4$ denotes the set of all those strings that either contain exactly
      one occurrence of the letter ``\texttt{a}'' or exactly one occurrence of the letter ``\texttt{b}''.
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{0.3cm}
      $L(r_4) = \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \;\Big|\;\; 
                        \#\bigl\{i \in \mathbb{N}_0 \,\big|\; w[i] = \texttt{a} \bigl\} \,=
                        1 \Bigr\} \;\cup\;
                \Bigl\{ w \in \Sigma^* \;\Big|\;\; 
                        \#\bigl\{i \in \mathbb{N}_0 \,\big|\; w[i] = \texttt{b} \bigl\} \,=
                        1 \Bigr\}$.  \eox 
\end{enumerate}

\remarkEng 
The syntax of regular expressions given here is the same as the syntax used in  \cite{hopcroft:06}
and \cite{sipser:2006}.   However, the syntax used for regular expression in programming languages
like  \textsl{Java} is different.  We will discuss these differences later when we introduce \textsl{JFlex}.

\exerciseEng
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\alph{enumi})}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume $\Sigma = \{ \mathtt{a}, \mathtt{b}, \mathtt{c} \}$.  Define a regular expression for the language
      $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that consists of those strings that contain at least one occurrence of
      the letter ``\texttt{a}'' and one occurrence of the letter ``\texttt{b}''.
\item Assume $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.   Specify a regular expression for the language 
      $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ that consists of those strings $s$ such that the antepenultimate
      character is the symbol  ``$1$''.
\item Again, we have $\Sigma = \{ 0, 1 \}$.   Define a regular expression for the language
      $L \subseteq \Sigma^*$ containing all those strings that do not contain the substring  $110$.

      \solutionEng
      The regular expression $r$ that is sought for can be defined as 
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $r = (0 + 1 \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      First, it is quite obvious that the language $L(r)$ does not contain a string $w$ such that
      $w$ contains the substring $110$.  This is so because a character $1$ that is generated by the
      part $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$ is immediately followed by a $0$.  Hence if $w$ contains the
      substring $110$, the first $1$ cannot originate from the regular expression $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.
      Furthermore, if the first $1$ of the substring 110 originates from the regular expression
      $1^*$, then there cannot be a $0$ following since the language generated by $1^*$ contains
      only ones.

      Second, assume that the string $w$ does not contain the substring $110$.  We have to show that
      $w \in L(r)$.  Now if the character $1$ does not occur in the
      string $w$, then $w$ is just a bunch of zeros and therefore $w$ can be generated by the
      regular expression $(0+1\cdot 0)^*$ and hence also by $(0 + 1  \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.  If the string $w$ does contain the character $1$,
      there are two cases.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item The first occurrence of $1$ is followed by a $0$.  Then the prefix of $w$ up to and
            including this $0$ is generated by the regular expression $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.  The
            remaining part of $w$ is shorter and, by induction, can be shown to be generated by 
            $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^* \cdot 1^*$.
      \item The first occurrence of $1$ is followed by another $1$.  In this case, the rest of $w$
            must be made up of ones.  Hence, the part of $w$ starting with the first $1$ is
            generated by $1^*$ and obviously the preceding zeros can all be generated by 
            $(0 + 1 \cdot 0)^*$.
      \end{enumerate}
\item Again, assume $\Sigma = \{0,1\}$.  What is the language $L$ generated by the regular expression 
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $(1 + \varepsilon)\cdot(0\cdot 0^* \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0^*$?  \eox

      \solutionEng
      This is the language $L$ such that the strings in $L$ do not contain the substring $11$.

\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\arabic{enumi}.}


\section{Algebraic Simplification of Regular Expressions}
Given two regular expressions $r_1$ and $r_2$, we write
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$r_1 \doteq r_2$ \quad iff \quad $L(r_1) = L(r_2)$,
\\[0.2cm]
i.e.~if $r_1$ and $r_2$ describe the same language.  If the equation $r_1 \doteq r_2$ holds, then we
call $r_1$ and $r_2$ \emph{equivalent}.  The following algebraic laws apply:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r_1 + r_2 \doteq r_2 + r_1$

      This equation is true because the union of sets is commutative:
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r_1 + r_2) = L(r_1) \cup L(r_2) = L(r_2) \cup L(r_1) = L(r_2 + r_1)$.
\item $(r_1 + r_2) + r_3 \doteq r_1 + (r_2 + r_3)$

      This equation is true because the union of sets is associative.
\item $(r_1 \cdot r_2) \cdot r_3 \doteq r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot r_3)$

      This equation is true because the concatenation of strings is associative, for any strings
      $u$, $v$, and $w$ we have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $(u v) w = u (v w)$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      This implies
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $
      \begin{array}[t]{lcl}
        L\bigl( (r_1 \cdot r_2) \cdot r_3\bigr) 
        & = & \bigl\{ x w \mid x \in L(r_1 \cdot r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ (u v) w \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge v \in L(r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ u (v w) \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge v \in L(r_2) \wedge w \in L(r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & \bigl\{ u y \mid u \in L(r_1) \wedge y \in L(r_2 \cdot r_3)\bigr) \\[0.1cm]
        & = & L\bigl( r_1 \cdot (r_2 \cdot r_3)\bigr).
      \end{array}
      $

      The following equations are more or less obvious.
\item $\emptyset \cdot r \doteq r \cdot \emptyset \doteq \emptyset$
\item $\varepsilon \cdot r \doteq r \cdot \varepsilon \doteq r$
\item $\emptyset + r \doteq r + \emptyset \doteq r$
\item $(r_1 + r_2) \cdot r_3 \doteq r_1 \cdot r_3 + r_2 \cdot r_3$
\item $r_1 \cdot (r_2 + r_3) \doteq r_1 \cdot r_2 + r_1 \cdot r_3$
\item $r + r \doteq r$, because
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r+r) = L(r) \cup L(r) = L(r)$.
\item $(r^*)^* \doteq r^*$      

      We have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r^*) = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0} L(r)^n$ 
      \\[0.2cm]
      and that implies $L(r) \subseteq L(r^*)$.   If we replace  $r$ by  $r^*$, we see that
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L(r^*) \subseteq L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$
      \\[0.2cm]
      holds.  In order to prove the inclusion
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) \subseteq L(r^*)$,
      \\[0.2cm]
      we consider the structure of the strings  $w \in L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$.
      Because of
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) = \bigcup\limits_{n \in \mathbb{N}_0} L(r^*)^n$
      \\[0.2cm]
      we have $w \in L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr)$ if and only if there is an $n \in \mathbb{N}_0$
      such that there are strings $u_1, \cdots,u_n \in L(r^*)$ satisfying
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $w = u_1 \cdots u_n$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Because of $u_i \in L(r^*)$ we find a number $m(i) \in \mathbb{N}_0$ for every $i \in \{1,\cdots,n\}$ 
      such that for  $j=1,\cdots, m(i)$ there are strings $v_{i,j} \in L(r)$ satisfying
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $u_i = v_{1,i} \cdots v_{m(i),i}$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Combining these equations yields
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $w = v_{1,1} \cdots v_{m(1),1} v_{1,2} \cdots v_{m(2),2} \cdots v_{1,n} \cdots v_{m(n),n}$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Hence $w$ is a concatenation of strings from the language $L(r)$ and hence we have
      \\[0.2cm]

      $w \in L\bigl(r^*\bigr)$.

      This shows the inclusion
      $L\bigl((r^*)^*\bigr) \subseteq L(r^*)$.
\item $\emptyset^* \doteq \varepsilon$

Unfortunately there is no system of equations that is complete in the sense that is allows to derive
every valid equation between regular expressions.
However, there is \emph{rule of inference} that is complete, if used on top of the equations above.
This rule is the following:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\bruch{\;r \doteq r \cdot s + t \quad \varepsilon \not\in L(s)\;}{r \doteq t \cdot s^*}$
\\[0.2cm]
This rule is interpreted as follows:  If we are able to prove that the equation
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$r \doteq r \cdot s + t$
\\[0.2cm]
holds and if, furthermore, the language $L(s)$ does not contain the empty string,
then we can conclude that
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$r \doteq t \cdot s^*$ 
\\[0.2cm]
holds.  We call this rule \emph{Salomaa's rule}.  The correctness of Salomaa's rule is shown in the
next lemma.


\begin{Lemma}
  Assume that $r$, $s$ and $t$ are regular expressions such that
  \\[0.2cm]
  \hspace*{1.3cm}
  $r \doteq r \cdot s + t$
  \\[0.2cm]
  holds and assume furthermore, that $\varepsilon \not\in L(s)$.  Then we have
  \\[0.2cm]
  \hspace*{1.3cm}
  $r \doteq t \cdot s^*$.
\end{Lemma}

\proofEng
By our assumption we know that 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r1}
  L(r) = L(r) \cdot L(s) \cup L(t)  
\end{equation}
holds.  We have to show that 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r2}
  L(r) = L(t) \cdot L(s^*)  
\end{equation}
holds.  The proof is  split into two parts.  First, we show that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r3}
  L(r) \subseteq L(t) \cdot L(s^*)  
\end{equation}
holds.  Assume some $x \in L(r)$ is given.  We show by induction on the length of the string $x$
that this implies $x \in L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$.   According to the assumption  $(\ref{eq:r1})$ we have
$x \in L(r) \cdot L(s) \cup L(t)$ and hence there are two cases:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$x \in L(r) \cdot L(s)$ \quad or \quad $x \in L(t)$.
\\[0.2cm]
We treat these cases separately and start with the easy case.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $x \in L(t)$.

      Since we have  $\varepsilon \in L(s^*)$ this implies
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $x = x\varepsilon \in L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Effectively, this case is the base case of our induction.
\item $x \in L(r) \cdot L(s)$.

      Then  $x$ can be split into two substrings $y$ and $z$ such that
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $x = yz$, \quad $y \in L(r)$, \quad and \quad  $z \in L(s)$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      Since we assume that $\varepsilon \not\in L(s)$, we know that  $|z|>0$ and hence we must have
      $|y| < |x|$.  Therefore by induction hypotheses we conclude that
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $y \in L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$
      \\[0.2cm]
      holds.  Hence we have
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $x = yz \in L(t) \cdot L(s^*) \cdot L(s) \subseteq L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$
      \\[0.2cm]
      and therefore we have shown that $L(r) \subseteq L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$ holds.
\end{enumerate}
Next, we show that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:r4}
  L(t \cdot s^*) \subseteq L(r)
\end{equation}
holds.  Assume  a string  $x \in L(t \cdot s^*)$ is given.  We have to show that 
$x \in L(r)$.  Because of  $x \in L(t \cdot s^*)$,  $x$ can be written as
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$x = y z_1 \cdots z_m$ \quad where $y \in L(t)$ and $z_i \in L(s)$ for all $i=1,\cdots,m$,
\\[0.2cm]
We will show by induction on  $m \in \mathbb{N}_0$ that
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$x = y z_1 \cdots z_m \in L(r)$ \quad holds for all $m \in \mathbb{N}_0$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item[B.C..:] $m= 0$.

             Then we have $x = y \in L(t)$ and from the assumption (\ref{eq:r1}) we conclude
             $y \in L(r)$.
\item[I.S.:] $m \mapsto m + 1$.

             By induction hypotheses we know that
             \\[0.2cm]
             \hspace*{1.3cm}
             $y z_1 \cdots z_m \in L(r)$.
             \\[0.2cm]
             Because of equation (\ref{eq:r1}) we have
             \\[0.2cm]
             \hspace*{1.3cm}
             $y z_1 \cdots z_m z_{m+1} \in L(r) \cdot L(s) \subseteq L(r)$
             \\[0.2cm]
             and hence the induction is complete.
\end{enumerate}
Combining the two parts of the proof we conclude that  $L(r) = L(t) \cdot L(s^*)$ holds..
\qed



\remarkEng
The fact that the equations given above and Salomaa's rule are sufficient to prove the validity of
any equation involving regular expressions is a deep result that requires a proof that we cannot
present here.  This proof can be found in a paper by Arto Salomaa \cite{salomaa:66}.

\exerciseEng
Proof the following equation using Salomaa's rule and the equations given above:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$1 \cdot 0 \cdot (1 \cdot 0)^* \doteq  1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0$.
\vspace*{0.1cm}

\solutionEng 
We prove the equation using  Salomaa's rule
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm} $\bruch{\;r \doteq r \cdot s + t \quad \varepsilon \not\in L(s)\;}{r \doteq t \cdot s^*}$.
\\[0.2cm]
In order to use this rule we define 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm} $t := 1 \cdot 0$, \quad $s := 1 \cdot 0$ \quad and \quad 
$r := 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0$.
\\[0.2cm]
Next, we show that  $r \doteq r \cdot s + t$ holds.  Substituting $r$, $s$, and $t$ yields
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0 \eqmark 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0  \cdot (1 \cdot 0) + 1 \cdot 0$. 
\hspace*{\fill} $(\star)$
\\[0.2cm]
In order to prove $(\star)$ we manipulate the right hand side of this equation as follows:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$
\begin{array}[t]{cll}
       & 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0  \cdot (1 \cdot 0) + 1 \cdot 0                 \\
\doteq & 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot (0  \cdot 1) \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0               & 
         \mbox{(associativity)} \\
\doteq & 1 \cdot \bigl( (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot (0  \cdot 1) + \varepsilon\bigr)\cdot 0 & 
         \mbox{(distributivity)} \\
\doteq & 1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0 & 
         \mbox{(since $r^* \doteq \varepsilon + r^* \cdot r$)} \\
\end{array}
$
\\[0.2cm]
Now the final term in this chain of equations is exactly the left hand side of  equation  $(\star)$,
which is thereby proven.  Furthermore, it is obvious that
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
 $\varepsilon \not\in L(1 \cdot 0)$.  
\\[0.2cm]
Therefore, the two assumptions of Salomaa's rule are satisfied and hence the equation
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$r \doteq t \cdot s^*$
\\[0.2cm]
is valid.  Substituting  $r$, $s$ and $t$ yields
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$1 \cdot (0 \cdot 1)^* \cdot 0 \doteq (1 \cdot 0) \cdot (1 \cdot 0)^*$
\\[0.2cm]
and that was the claim.  \qed

\remarkEng
The previous exercise has shown that the use of Salomaa's rule can be quite tedious.  Fortunately,
we will later develop an algorithm for showing the equivalence of two regular expressions.  It is
straightforward to implement this algorithm.  However, before we can present the algorithm, we have
to develop the theory of finite state machines.
